This repo holds a simple sample Vue.js app. In order to run it, you just need to do the following simple steps:

### Clone the code to your computer

## In a CLI (I used powershell straight in VSCode) navigate to the /cocktails/ folder then run:
```
npm install
```

## Once that is finished, run:
```
npm run serve
```

All that's left is to navigate to the proper localhost as given by Node, and look at that simple and clean web app!
